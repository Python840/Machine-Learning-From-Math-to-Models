# 💻 CodePens & Interactive Snippets

This directory contains **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** code snippets extracted from the book.  
You can **download** them, **copy-paste** into your own projects, or **visit live demos on CodePen**. 🚀  

---

## 📌 **How to Use**
✅ Each snippet is stored in its own **separate file**:
- **`.html`** → HTML structure  
- **`.css`** → Styling (CSS)  
- **`.js`** → JavaScript logic  


---

### **➡️ Option 1: Download & Run Locally**
1. Click the **Download ZIP** button on GitHub.  
2. Extract the files to your local computer.  
3. Open the folder of the snippet you want (e.g., `SVM/`).  
4. Open **`SVM.html`** in your browser—this will automatically load the CSS & JS.  

---

### **➡️ Option 2: Copy-Paste Code (Example**
If you don’t want to download, you can manually copy-paste the code from:  
- **`SVM.html`** → The main HTML structure.  
- **`SVM.css`** → The styling.  
- **`SVM.js`** → The logic.
