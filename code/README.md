# Code Implementations

This directory contains **code implementations** of the Machine Learning concepts covered in the book.  
It includes **models, algorithms, and mathematical functions**, allowing readers to experiment with real implementations.  

These code snippets are meant to be **interactive supplements** to the book, helping bridge theory and practice.

---

## 📌 What's Inside?
✅ **Machine Learning models** coded from scratch.  
✅ **Neural Networks implementations** (without deep learning frameworks).  
✅ **Reinforcement Learning agents** demonstrating AI behavior.  
✅ **Mathematical implementations** of core AI concepts.  
✅ **Code snippets for practical experimentation and modification.**  

Files are **organized by topic**, making it easy to navigate.

## 🔹 How to Use
- **Browse** the available folders to find relevant code.  
- **Download or copy** snippets for experimentation.  
- Some implementations may include **README.md files** with further explanations.  

These scripts are designed to **supplement the book** with hands-on applications of the concepts discussed.

## 🚀 More Coming Soon!
This directory will be expanded with **additional implementations** over time, covering:
- Advanced Machine Learning techniques.  
- More neural network architectures.  
- Reinforcement learning strategies.
